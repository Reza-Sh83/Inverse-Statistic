        "# Introduction to the Problem: Analyzing Waiting Times for Gold Price Movements\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement:\n",
        "We aim to analyze gold price movements using a time-series dataset sampled at 1-minute intervals.\n",
        "Specifically, the goal is to determine the waiting time required for the price to either increase or decrease\n",
        "by a specified amount (e.g., $5, $10, $20) relative to the current price.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps Involved:\n",
        "1. **Data Processing**:\n",
        "   - Load the gold price dataset from a text file.\n",
        "   - Extract the price information into a usable format for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Waiting Time Calculation**:\n",
        "   - For each price point in the dataset:\n",
        "     - Calculate the time it takes for the price to increase by a given increment.\n",
        "     - Similarly, calculate the time it takes for the price to decrease by the same increment.\n",
        "   - If the condition is not met within the dataset, mark the waiting time as infinity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Visualize the waiting times for each increment and direction using bar plots.\n",
        "   - Analyze the distribution of waiting times using histograms.\n",
        "   - Analyze the scatter plots of the Emperical PDFs for the waiting times\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "Suppose the current price is $1800, and the increment is $10:\n",
        "- If the price reaches $1810 in 3 minutes, the waiting time for an increase is 3 minutes.\n",
        "- If the price drops to $1790 in 7 minutes, the waiting time for a decrease is 7 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Usage:\n",
        "- This analysis can help traders and investors understand how long they might need to wait for significant price changes.\n",
        "- It provides insights into market volatility and price dynamics over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Requirements:\n",
        "- The dataset should contain gold prices sampled at 1-minute intervals in plain text format,\n",
        "  where each line contains the price for a specific time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**:\n",
        "The analysis will produce:\n",
        "1. Bar plots showing the waiting times for each price increment and direction.\n",
        "2. Histograms depicting the distribution of waiting times for both increases and decreases.\n",

        "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",

        "   - `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt` for data visualization (to be used later).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Define File Path**:\n",
        "   - The file path to the gold price data (`Gold_TimeWindow_1min.txt`) is specified. This file contains time-series data for gold prices sampled at 1-minute intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Read and Process File**:\n",
        "   - The file is opened and read line by line using the `with open` statement for efficient file handling.\n",
        "   - Each line is processed to extract the gold price (assumed to be the first value in each line). These prices are converted to floating-point numbers and stored in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Convert Prices to Numpy Array**:\n",
        "   - The list of prices is converted to a `numpy` array for optimized numerical computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**: The `prices` variable contains an array of gold prices sampled at 1-minute intervals."

        "#### Steps:\n",
        "1. **Iterate Through Increments**:\n",
        "   - The code iterates through unique `increments` present in the `waiting_times_dict`, extracting the corresponding waiting times for both `\"increase\"` and `\"decrease\"` directions for each increment.\n",
        "   - For each increment, the waiting times are fetched using the dictionary keys `(increment, \"increase\")` and `(increment, \"decrease\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clean the Data**:\n",
        "   - The waiting times arrays for both directions are cleaned by removing `NaN` and `infinity` values using `np.isfinite`. This ensures that only valid waiting times are used in the subsequent analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculate Histograms and Normalize to PDFs**:\n",
        "   - For both directions, histograms are calculated using `np.histogram`, with the `density=True` parameter to normalize the histogram into a probability density function (PDF).\n",
        "   - The histograms are computed with 1000 bins for fine-grained results.\n",
        "   - The bin edges are then used to calculate the bin centers for plotting purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Plot the PDFs**:\n",
        "   - The histograms for the `\"increase\"` and `\"decrease\"` directions are plotted as scatter plots.\n",
        "   - The `increase` direction is represented by blue circles (`'o'`), while the `decrease` direction is represented by red crosses (`'x'`).\n",
        "   - The areas under the curves are filled with semi-transparent colors (blue for increase, red for decrease) to improve visibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Customize the Plot**:\n",
        "   - Labels are added to the x-axis and y-axis: \"Waiting Time (minutes)\" and \"Probability Density,\" respectively.\n",
        "   - A title is dynamically generated based on the current increment (e.g., \"Empirical PDFs of Waiting Times for Increment = 5\").\n",
        "   - A legend is added to distinguish between the `increase` and `decrease` directions.\n",
        "   - A grid is applied for better readability, and the layout is adjusted to ensure everything fits within the plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Display the Plot**:\n",
        "   - The plot is displayed using `plt.show()`, which renders the figure.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Notes:\n",
        "- **Probability Density**: The histograms are normalized to form a probability density function (PDF), making it easier to compare the relative frequency of waiting times for both directions.\n",
        "- **Transparency**: The use of alpha transparency in the fill areas helps make the overlapping regions more visible.\n",
        "- **Plot Customization**: Adjusting the plot's size and adding grid lines ensures that the visualization is clear and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**: A set of scatter plots showing the PDF of waiting times for both the `increase` and `decrease` directions, for each increment. The plots are color-coded for clarity and display the distribution of waiting times for better comparison.\n"
